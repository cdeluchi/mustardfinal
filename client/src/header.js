                Meditation on Twin Hearts is a simple yet powerful technique
                introduced by Master Choa Kok Sui for achieving cosmic
                consciousness or what we often call “illumination.” It is also a
                form of service to the world by increasing harmony and peace
                through becoming a channel to bless the earth with
                loving-kindness. In fact among all the techniques taught by
                Master Choa Kok Sui, perhaps none prompts as many glowing
                testimonials of personal healing and positive life
                transformation as the Meditation on Twin Hearts.
                <br />
                <br />
                Meditation on Twin Hearts is designed based on the principle
                that some of the major chakras such as the crown chakra are the
                entry points or gateways to certain levels of consciousness.
                Therefore to achieve illumination the crown chakra should be
                sufficiently activated. The crown chakra can only be activated
                when the heart chakra is first sufficiently activated.
                <br />
                <br />
                There are many ways of activating the heart and crown chakras,
                such as Hatha yoga, yogic breathing techniques, chanting mantras
                and visualization techniques. All of these techniques are
                effective but not fast enough. One of the most effective and
                fastest ways to activate these chakras is through the Meditation
                on Twin Hearts. It basically helps to transform the internal
                condition of the practitioner. When during meditation we
                transform despair into hope, doubt into faith and darkness into
                light, we will be filled internally with hope, faith and light.
                This in fact creates a healing and transforming effect.
