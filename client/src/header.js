                Hello my beautiful friends. I think here is more accetable place
                to organize our events and so on. Go ahead and let's discust our
                next place to meditate together.
                <br />
                <br />
                What is Meditation on Twin Hearts: Is a simple yet powerful
                technique introduced by Master Choa Kok Sui for achieving cosmic
                consciousness or what we often call “illumination.”
                <br />
                <br />
                It is also a form of service to the world by increasing harmony
                and peace through becoming a channel to bless the earth with
                loving-kindness.
                <br />
                In fact among all the techniques taught by Master Choa Kok Sui,
                perhaps none prompts as many glowing testimonials of personal
                healing and positive life transformation as the Meditation on
                Twin Hearts.
                <br />
